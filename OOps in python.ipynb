    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming pattern based on the concept of objects. Objects consists of data and methods. The object's data are it's properties, that defines what it is. And the object's methods, are it's functions, that defines what the object can do. Object-oriented style of programming is very popular because of it's ability to map the virtual world entities i.e. our code, to the real world objects. OOPS concepts are widely used by many popular programming languages due to the several advantages it provides.\n",
